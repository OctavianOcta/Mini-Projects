Some random mini projects

## A roll dice simulator for any kind of dice

  If you are playing a game and lack the dice, try this thing. It can be set on how many dice you want to roll and how many faces the dice you want to have for any kind of game.
  
## A password generator with random characters

  Generates a password out of random characters to stay secure. You won't use this anyway.
  
## Guess the number game made it easy

  The classic game where the computer thinks of a number and you have to guess it but it shows the interval where you have to guess.
  
  0 -- computer_guess -- 100  -> your_guess -- computer_guess -- your_guess
